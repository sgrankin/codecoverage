# Code Coverage Annotation

Reviewing test coverage information for a whole repository can be overwhelming
and hard to take action on. It's much more useful to catch gaps in coverage as
they're introduced to a repo, right in the context of pull requests!

All processing is done within Github Actions, no data is sent to an external server.

## Sample PR Annotation

## Inputs

| Key                  | Required | Default                  | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`       | **yes**  | -                        | Github Token generated by Github Action workflow. You can pass this in as `${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}` |
| `GITHUB_BASE_URL`    | **no**   | `https://api.github.com` | Base URL for GitHub API. Required for GitHub Enterprise Server or Cloud.                              |
| `COVERAGE_FILE_PATH` | **yes**  | -                        | Location of coverage file that was generated                                                          |
| `COVERAGE_FORMAT`    | **no**   | `lcov`                   | Format of coverage file. May be `lcov`, `clover`, `cobertura`, or `go`                                |
| `DEBUG`              | **no**   | -                        | Log debugging information. Comma-separated list of possible values `coverage`, `pr_lines_added`       |

## Usage

Add the action to your workflow file like so, replacing the file path and
coverage format with values appropriate for your repo:

```yaml
- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: ggilder/codecoverage@v1
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
    COVERAGE_FORMAT: "lcov"
```

## Usage with GitHub Enterprise Server or Cloud

You need to the `GITHUB_BASE_URL` input to point to your API endpoint to use this action with GitHub Enterprise Server or Cloud. For example:

```yaml
with:
  GITHUB_BASE_URL: https://github.acme-inc.com/api/v3 # for GitHub Enterprise Server
```
 or 

```yaml
with:
  GITHUB_BASE_URL: https://api.acme-inc.ghe.com # for GitHub Enterprise Cloud
```

### Golang Workflow Example

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: go test -v ./... -coverprofile coverage.out

- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: ggilder/codecoverage@v1
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: coverage.out
    COVERAGE_FORMAT: go
```

### Javascript/Typescript

Set up `npm run test:cov` in your `package.json` scripts to run `jest --coverage`, which will output Lcov formatted information to `coverage/lcov.info`.

### Other languages

* Java/Groovy can use Clover format
* PHPUnit will output Clover with the [`--coverage-clover` flag](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/10.2/textui.html#code-coverage)
* C++: GCC Gcov can output Lcov format; [this blog post](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/2021/07/gcov-example/) may help you get started.
* Ruby: Simplecov can output Lcov format when you add the [`simplecov-lcov`](https://github.com/fortissimo1997/simplecov-lcov) gem to your Gemfile. Make sure to set `SimpleCov::Formatter::LcovFormatter.config.report_with_single_file` to `true` and provide the path to the output file using `COVERAGE_FILE_PATH` as described above.

## Contributing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, ideally 16 or newer. Older versions will change the format of `package-lock.json`.

Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Run formatting and linting, build the typescript and package it for distribution, and run tests:
```bash
$ npm run all
```

Make sure you commit the `dist/` folder or CI will fail.

### Validate

You can validate the action while developing by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
  COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
```
