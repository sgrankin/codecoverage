# Code Coverage Annotation

Reviewing test coverage information for a whole repository can be overwhelming
and hard to take action on. It's much more useful to catch gaps in coverage as
they're introduced to a repo, right in the context of pull requests!

All processing is done within Github Actions, no data is sent to an external server.

## Usage

Add the action to your workflow file like so, replacing the file path and
coverage format with values appropriate for your repo:

```yaml
- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    coverage_file_path: "./coverage/lcov.info"
    coverage_format: "lcov"
```

## Usage with GitHub Enterprise Server or Cloud

You need to set the `github_base_url` input to point to your API endpoint to use this action with GitHub Enterprise Server or Cloud. For example:

```yaml
with:
  github_base_url: https://github.acme-inc.com/api/v3 # for GitHub Enterprise Server
```
 or 

```yaml
with:
  github_base_url: https://api.acme-inc.ghe.com # for GitHub Enterprise Cloud
```

### Multiple Coverage Files

You can specify multiple coverage files using glob patterns or newline-separated paths:

```yaml
# Using glob pattern
- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    coverage_file_path: "**/coverage.out"
    coverage_format: go

# Using multiple paths
- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    coverage_file_path: |
      packages/frontend/coverage/lcov.info
      packages/backend/coverage/lcov.info
    coverage_format: lcov
```

### Golang Workflow Example

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: go test -v ./... -coverprofile coverage.out

- name: Code Coverage Annotation
  uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    coverage_file_path: coverage.out
    coverage_format: go
```

### Javascript/Typescript

Set up `npm run test:cov` in your `package.json` scripts to run `jest --coverage`, which will output Lcov formatted information to `coverage/lcov.info`.

### Other languages

* C++: GCC Gcov can output Lcov format; [this blog post](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/2021/07/gcov-example/) may help you get started.
* Ruby: Simplecov can output Lcov format when you add the [`simplecov-lcov`](https://github.com/fortissimo1997/simplecov-lcov) gem to your Gemfile. Make sure to set `SimpleCov::Formatter::LcovFormatter.config.report_with_single_file` to `true` and provide the path to the output file using `COVERAGE_FILE_PATH` as described above.

## Coverage Delta

This action can track coverage changes over time by storing baseline coverage data in git notes. When a pull request is opened, the action compares the current coverage against the baseline to show whether coverage has increased or decreased.

### How It Works

1. **On push to main**: The action runs in `store-baseline` mode, storing coverage data as a git note attached to the commit.
2. **On pull requests**: The action runs in `pr-check` mode, loading the baseline from the merge-base commit and calculating the delta.

### Workflow Configuration

To enable coverage deltas, you need to:

1. **Add `contents: write` permission** to push git notes
2. **Run the action on both PRs and pushes to main**

```yaml
name: Tests
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write  # Required for git notes
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for merge-base detection

      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: npm test -- --coverage

      - name: Code Coverage
        uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          coverage_file_path: coverage/lcov.info
```

### Summary Output

When a baseline is available, the summary shows the delta:

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----: |
| **Coverage** | 85.50% (↑2.50%) |
| **Baseline** | 83.00% |

### Mode Override

You can manually control the mode:

```yaml
# Force pr-check mode (useful for debugging)
- uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    mode: pr-check
    # ...

# Force store-baseline mode (useful for scheduled runs)
- uses: sgrankin/codecoverage@main
  with:
    mode: store-baseline
    # ...
```
